#### CIS Assessment Tool

Open local browser and navigate to the CIS homepage, https://cisecurity.org

Select theCybersecurity Tools tab.

Scroll down and take a look at the options available. On the right of the page you cansee a color code for resources that are free, and others are paid.

Select the CIS-CAT Lite automated assessment tool. We will test Ubuntu, both to ensurewe are secure as well as to see a sample of what the assessment does and eventuallyreturns. Fill out the form on the right and submit. This will cause an email to be sent to you.

Inside the email you will eventually receive you will find the option to download version3 or version 4. Instead of clicking on the green button, hover with the mouse overversion v4 and copy the link. Then log into your exercise node and use the
wget command to retrieve the file.

As this manner of download creates a long and difficult file name you can use the mvcommand and tab to rename it to something easier, like CIS-Cat.zip.

To extract the files we may first have to install the unzip command.
# sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install unzip

Use the newly installed command to extract all the files. After extraction change intothe newly created directory.
unzip CIS-Cat.zip

The assessment tool requires JAVA. Install the software then set the JAVA_PATHvariable.

# sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk -y && export JAVA_PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/

Run the Assessor-CLI.sh script without any options. You should see some warnings anda text graphic, followed by help information. Among that information note the levels ofverbosity as well as the -i option to run an interactive assessment. Use the sudocommand as the tool requires root ability.

# sudo bash Assessor-CLI.sh

Run the program again, this time pass the -i option. When the Select Content promptappears enter the number 5, to assess Ubuntu.

# sudo bash Assessor-CLI.sh -i

You should then see options about what level of testing you want to do. Chose option1. There will be a lot of output following. Take a moment to scan through the hundredsof tests. Some will pass, some will fail. At the end of the output you should see totalassessment time and a location for the HTML report.
