Docker Bench Security

Clone the git repository and run the docker-bench-security tool against your cluster. Therewill be quite a bit of output.

# git clone https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security.git
# cd docker-bench-security
# ./docker-bench-security.sh

Use your Linux skills to pass some tests.

# apt install auditd
# systemctl start auditd
# auditctl -w /etc/docker -p wa -k DOCKER_FILE

Run the docker-bench-security.sh script again. Check on score and also check PASS againstthe previous warning.

# ./docker-bench-security.sh
