Using the kube-bench tool

Now that we have a cluster and have already viewed the CIS Benchmark in a previous task, you can also use the kubebench tool from Aquasecurity which shows a text output of the issues followed by commands to run. This may allow an easier path to keeping your environment secure.

Download the Aquasecurity kube-bench binary.

# curl -L https://bit.ly/32BQF8G -o kube-bench_0.3.1_linux_amd64.deb

Install and verify the binary is in your search path.

# sudo apt install ./kube-bench_0.3.1_linux_amd64.deb -f
# which kube-bench

Run the kube-bench command to check

# kube-bench master

Compare the results with what you saw with the official CIS benchmark PDF we looked atin a previous exercise. They should be very similar to each other.
